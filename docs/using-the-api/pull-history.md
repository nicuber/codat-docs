Similar functionality is available for [push history](/configure/portal/pull-and-push-history).

## Via API

Coming soon!

## In the Portal

When viewing a company in the Portal, you can view **Pull history** to check the status of previous pull and push data syncs by data type.

`Companies > Company > Data history > Pull history`

When a pull of data is initialized, items will appear here for each data type being pulled.

You can see:

- Type - data type name, with integration name below
- ID - the ID of the pull for that data type
- Requested date
- Time to complete
- Status

Where an pull encounters a validation error, you can click on the status to see more information.
