Codat supports the following event types you can [consume](/using-the-api/webhooks/create-consumer) using the Codat Portal or our API. Use them to respond to changes in your companies and their data.

Navigate to **Monitor > Webhooks > Events > Event Catalog** to view this list and each event's payload directly in the [Portal](https://app.codat.io/monitor/events). 

:::caution Still using our `/rules` endpoints?

The names of our new event types differ from our legacy rule types. We added the legacy name column to the table below so you can easily determine which event type you need to consume.
