It is important customers feel comfortable authorising third parties to access their accounting data and fully understand why they are being asked to do so.

Be transparent and make sure your customers understand:

What data is being collected and the purpose Accounts, Bank Transactions, Customers etc for lending, expense management etc.
How often the data will be synchronised One-off synchronisation versus scheduled updates and how they can see when their data has been collected.
Who will have access Who will have access to their data, if it will be shared with any third parties and why.
Terms & Conditions

It is recommended your authorisation workflow include terms & conditions or data access guidelines in some form to clearly outline who has access to the data and what it will be used for.

Depending on your use case there may be a number of agreements including:

Between the platform distribution partner and their client
Between the client and the end user (company)
Frequently Asked Questions

Below are some frequently asked questions and answers to help customers understand the benefits of sharing their data and how their data will be handled. These may help shape your own guidelines shared as part of your authorisation workflow.

Why do I need to connect my accounting platform?

Detail the advantages of linking their data (subject to use case):

Accelerated access to credit or services

Automating the collect of accounting data will speed up access to the credit or services being applied for. The information can be processed faster and more efficiently resulting in the potential for faster response.

Removing the hassle of manually submitting financial data

Connecting directly with accounting platforms saves times and resources, removing the need to manually prepare submissions to access credit or other services.

Security

Data extracted manually and shared via email or physically by post is at higher risk of theft or loss. Data shared directly via the accounting platform is protected via robust security protocols that meet GDPR standards.

Data reliability

Sharing data directly from accounting platforms reduces the risk of human error, giving lenders more confidence in the financial data provided.

Automation

Providing access to accounting platforms allows the provider to automate previously manual processes such as reconciliation of payments, creating invoices or importing bank transactions etc.      

Example 1

We are looking to improve security around data sharing by leveraging the strict consent mechanisms used by accounting platform providers. Our customers will be asked to login and connect their accounting platform, to securely share the requested financial information required for your application and on-going monitoring of your credit facility.

This means our customers will be explicitly giving their consent to share their accounting data with us only, and this connection can be removed at any time, should you choose. And don't worry – your data is encrypted and protected in line with modern safety standards.

Example 2

Our integrations aim to simplify your experience:

We retrieve your latest balance sheets and profit and loss statement – so you don’t need to provide any information manually.
We update data automatically to ensure we keep pace with your business and ask you no unnecessary questions, saving you time.
How secure is my data?

Data is held to the highest levels of data security, encrypted both at transit and at rest.  The data is protected to the standards required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Can I ask for my data to be deleted?

Customers may ask for their data to be deleted. Under GDPR regulations individuals have the right to have their data deleted, known as “the right to be forgotten”.

This also applies when the data you have collected is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was originally collected for.

Be clear on how customers can revoke access to their accounting platform and any stored data deleted or who they should contact with concerns.

Can data be shared via Excel or PDF?

When customers continue to ask to manually share data this often indicates a lack of understanding of the advantages of granting access to their data.  Be clear about the options and why the process has been automated.
