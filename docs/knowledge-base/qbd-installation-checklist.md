If a user wants to install the QuickBooks Desktop connector on their computer, there are a few tasks that the user should first complete.

### Hosted QuickBooks or Remote Working

Please make sure the user is installing the connector on the machine where QuickBooks Desktop is installed. If the user has a VPN or Remote Connection to access QuickBooks on their own company's server, they should install the connector on that machine.

If the user works with an hosted instance of QuickBooks Desktop (eg. Right Networks), they must first be approved by Right Networks before proceeding. Please review our pre-requirements documentation here.

### Check version is supported

Your customer will need to be running a supported version of QuickBooks Desktop Pro, Enterprise or Professional. QuickBooks for Mac is not supported. A full list of supported versions is available on our docs.

### Operating system

The connector works on Windows 10, Windows 11 and Windows Server 2019, and may not work correctly on earlier versions of Windows. Your customer will need administrator permissions on your computer to complete the installation.

### QuickBooks Desktop User Account

They will need to have QuickBooks Desktop open during the installation using an account that has administrator permissions.

### Antivirus and Firewalls

The users local antivirus or firewall settings may prevent the download and running of the connector, in this case you will need to whitelist the connector.

### Verify Data Integrity

Your customer should also backup their QuickBooks Desktop file and verify data integrity, they can do this by logging into QuickBooks and selecting File > Utilities > Verify Data.
