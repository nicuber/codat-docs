Depending on the use case we can provide solution proposals to support your evaluation or discuss requirements for a proof of concept.

We can also introduce our Product team who bring sector specific knowledge to ensure you get the most out of Codat.

As a client you will have access to UAT and Production instances.

Instances will be created and handed over for Configuration.

The team will be on hand for calls or emails to support you through the entire implementation and testing phases.

4.  Implementation

Owner: Client – Technical Lead

This section provides an overview of the steps required to quickly setup an instance. Each instance requires one-off configuration prior to onboarding any companies. Detailed instructions will be provided in our guides.

Monitoring rules and alerts Configure rules to monitor company connections and successful synchronisations to alert via email or webhooks.
5. Testing

Owner: Client

Test your linking flow with the Sandbox environment or demo companies with your chosen accounting platforms.

Internal training

Ensure your team supporting clients onboarding have visibility of the flow and experience the linking process themselves (sandbox recommended as no additional accounts required). This could be done as part of training session.

Pilot launch

You may wish to include a pilot launch as part of your testing. Identifying a select group to trial the functionality to gather valuable feedback to test the workflow, data sharing guidelines and overall willingness to share accounting data.

6. Launch

Launch with your customer base.

Additional communication may be required to reassure them of the process including what data is being synchronised, what it is going to be used and who it is going to be shared with.

Marketing

Our marketing team would be happy to help with shared announcements and potential use cases.

Client onboarding

When managing Codat as a partner there are a few operational decisions to consider:

Who will own the configuration
Each instance requires one-off configuration before it is ready for onboarding
For cloud platforms: configuration includes the setup of a developer application within the accounting platform and in some cases approval or contracts before accessing production accounting data
This can be handled by the client or by the partner on-behalf of their clients.
Who will manage and maintain the instance
Who will need on-going access to the Portal including API key(s)
The responsible party should be aware of our Support process and online documentation.
Action required

When onboarding new clients your decision on who owns the configuration and management will impact who should be initially setup on the environment:

Client owned Please provide the clients technical lead as the Admin email
Distributor owned Please provide your own technical leads as the Admin email
Client creation

Codat has two environment:

Staging: Hosts all UAT, Testing and Dev instances
Production: Hosts all Production instances

When onboarding a new client you will need to request the creation of new instance(s) depending on their requirements.

Email solutions@codat.io with:
Company Name
Instances: UAT and/or Production
Admin Email(s): Email address for the technical lead(s) who will own configuration of the instance(s)
Creation and handover
Our Solutions team will setup and checkout your new environment(s) before handover
Email confirmation
Once the instance is ready your Admin(s) will receive a confirmation email and invitation to set their password
If a multi instance user the instance(s) will be added to their view (note staging and production environments remain separate)
