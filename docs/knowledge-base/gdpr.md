## What do these FAQs cover?

These FAQs provide a high-level explanation of Codat's data processing positioning in relation to the provision of the Codat Service. Put another way, these FAQs set out what role Codat considers that it plays from a data protection perspective in relation to the provision of Codat Services to Clients; and what obligations Codat has as a result under the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). They explain the measures that Codat needs to comply with (and to help its Clients to comply with) under GDPR.

## Can you remind me how the Codat Service works?

Codat provides a cloud-based SaaS solution (the "Codat Service") to financial institutional clients ("Clients"). More specifically, Codat provides an API solution to enable its Clients to integrate directly with the accounting and banking software used by their own customers (typically small to medium businesses) ("Companies").

## Why is data protection law relevant to Codat and its Clients?

Data protection law in the European Union ("EU") gives individuals the right to control how their personal information is used and places legal obligations on organisations that collect, use and share personal information to safeguard such information. Current EU data protection law derives from the GDPR, which is in force in each EU Member State (subject to specific local law derogations permitted under the GDPR), along with local data protection laws that go above and beyond the requirements of the GDPR.

EU data protection law is relevant to Codat and its Clients because, in the course of providing the Codat Services, Codat will facilitate Client access to Company information ("Client Data"). A small amount of the Client Data may contain limited personal data about individuals in the Companies (for example, business contact details), particularly if the Company is a sole trader. As such, it is possible that Codat will process personal data in order to provide the Codat Service to the Client. As Codat is established in the UK, this means that Codat will be subject to the GDPR in relation to any processing activities that it carries out (i.e. any use that Codat makes of personal data).

## What is personal data?

Personal data is defined in the GDPR as "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person". In practice, these means essentially any information about a living individual, including real world identifiers (such as name, address, birthdate, etc.) and unique identifiers (such as an individual's IP address or advertising ID in their mobile phone). In relation to the Codat Service, Codat only uses limited personal data, primarily business contact details of individuals at the Companies.

## Who must comply with data protection law?

The GDPR sets out the concepts of “controllers” and “processors”. The distinction between these two roles is really important, as the GDPR imposes different obligations on controllers as it does on processors. In addition, for the first time, processors are directly liable under law in relation to certain obligations – this was not the case under older EU data protection law.

To explain the difference between these two roles:

Controllers: A "controller" is an entity which alone or jointly with others determines the "purposes and means" of the processing of personal information (or, put another way, the "why and how" personal information is processed). In practice, the key aspect of this definition is the ability to decide how personal information is being collected, stored, used, altered and disclosed. As explained above, controllers have specific statutory responsibilities under GDPR, and these responsibilities are overseen and enforced by national data protection authorities.
Processors: By contrast, a processor is an entity that processes personal information only on behalf of a controller and strictly in accordance with its instructions, normally pursuant to a service agreement. Data processors do not have any decision-making autonomy when processing personal information. Under the GDPR, processors have direct statutory obligations (for example, in relation to putting in place appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect personal data) and are obliged to agree to certain contractual terms with the controllers they service. This means that processors can be both liable for data protection breaches under contract, as well as liable under law.
Are Clients controllers or processors of their employees' personal information?

Every business is a controller of its own employees' personal information – the business necessarily has to make its own decisions "why and how" employees' information is used for employment administration purposes. Each Client is therefore always a controller of its own employees' personal information. Similarly, Codat is a controller of its own employee's personal data.

Is Codat a controller or a processor of any personal data in the Client Data?

As with most service relationships, Codat is primarily the processor of the personal information that it processes for its Clients in relation to the provision of the Codat Service. However, Codat is also a controller of certain personal data that it receives from (or on behalf of) the Client and, as a controller, Codat is directly responsible for ensuring compliance with data protection laws in relation to such processing.

To explain, while Codat primarily acts as a processor and has no control over the types of personal data that Clients may require Codat to facilitate access to during the provision of the Codat Service, Codat does use certain types of personal data that it receives in the course of providing the Codat Service for its own internal purposes. This includes retaining Client Data for legal obligations, resolving disputes, security reasons and for enforcing its agreements. In addition, both Codat and the Client will act as a controller in relation to business contact details they hold and use about the other party for the purposes of contract management i.e. to actually manage the contract for the provision of the Codat Service to the Client.

## What does it mean for Codat to be a processor in practice?

In practice, Codat's role as a processor means:

Clients will determine how and why Codat processes the personal data in Client Data in relation to the provision of the Codat Services. For example, Clients will decide what personal data should be accessed from the Company systems; and Codat will typically only use this information upon instruction by the Client (i.e. to provide the Codat Service).
Under the GDPR, both Clients and Codat will have direct responsibility and liability for certain obligations. Furthermore, as Codat will be required to accept certain contractual data protection obligations within its service contract with Clients (the "Service Agreement") and to statutory data protection requirements, there is greater protection for the individual to whom the relevant personal data relates.
## What does it mean for Codat to be a controller in practice?

In practice, Codat’s role as a controller means:

Codat is directly responsible for compliance with applicable data protection requirements. In relation to this type of processing, Clients will not be responsible or liable for complying with GDPR and Codat will be responsible for Codat’s security and use of personal data. For example, Codat is responsible for being transparent and informing the relevant individuals about how it collects and uses personal data in its privacy notice.
As a controller, can Codat do whatever it wants with the personal data it holds in relation to the Codat Service?

No. Codat is only permitted to use the personal data it receives in relation to the Codat Service as agreed in the Service Agreement and as set out in Codat’s privacy notice.

Will the personal data in the Client Data ever be transferred outside Europe?

If Codat’s Client is located outside of Europe, then yes – of course!

Aside from that, Codat has set up its business processes and supply lines to retain all Client Data in the EU. For example, while Codat uses Microsoft Azure to provide hosting and storage services as part of the Codat Service, Codat has contractually obliged Microsoft to store all Client Data in the UK.

How does Codat comply with EU data export rules?

At present, the Codat Service does not involve international data transfers outside of Europe, so there is no need to consider EU data export rules.

Does Codat need to sign model clauses with any of its suppliers?

No. At present, Codat does not transfer personal data outside the EEA in relation to the provision of the Codat Service. However, if Codat was ever to change its supply-chain (or if Microsoft changed its terms), then Codat may need to consider how to lawfully satisfy any international data transfer issues.

## What security measures does Codat apply to protect personal data in the Client Data?

Codat is committed to ensuring that all personal data it uses is secure. Codat implements appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect personal data against: (i) accidental or unlawful destruction; and (ii) loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access.

In particular, Codat has in place administrative, physical, and technical safeguards implemented in accordance with Codat's existing data security program, which includes:

- limiting access to information on Codat's information system media to authorized users;
- limiting physical access to Codat's information systems and related equipment to authorized individuals;
regular assessments of information security risks to Codat's information systems and associated information processing activities and of the effectiveness of - information security controls in Codat's information systems;
- annual training of users of Codat's information systems regarding the information security risks associated with their activities and applicable laws and policies; and
- imposition of formal sanctions for Codat personnel failing to comply with Codat's information security policies and procedures.

In addition, Codat encrypts all data at rest and in transit and has IP security in place. Please see the Codat Technology Overview for further information.

## Can Clients audit Codat's security measures?

Codat is regularly audited against ISO27001 standards by independent third party auditors. Upon Client's reasonable request, Codat can provide the Client with a summary copy of our audit reports.

Codat cannot accommodate on-premises audits by Clients, but does take full responsibility to ensure the security of all personal data in the Client Data. Codat complies with ISO27001 and conducts several audits throughout the year that provide assurances that Codat's controls are properly and securely managed.

## What is Codat doing to satisfy its GDPR compliance obligations?

Codat takes its responsibilities in relation to data management seriously and has taken steps to ensure that it has appropriate measures in place to satisfy its obligations under GDPR in relation to the Codat Service.

Codat hasengaged external legal specialists to help Codat update (or document) its processes, policies and controls to GDPR standard.

Amongst other GDPR initiatives, our efforts include:

- Drafting our Processor Article 30 GDPR records;
- Updating our Service Contracts to reflect Codat's preferred Article 28 GDPR terms;
- Documenting Codat's Information Security Policy and processes to ensure there are appropriate security measures in place to protect personal data;
- Updating Codat's Breach Notification/Security Incident Response Plan to reflect GDPR standards;
- Reviewing and updating Codat Employment Contracts to ensure that appropriate confidentiality provisions are imposed on employees;
- Providing data protection training to all Codat employees to ensure that Client Data is handled appropriately;
- Documenting an analysis as to why Codat does not require a GDPR Data Protection Officer; and
- Engaging with outside experts to assist with overall strategy and project delivery.
