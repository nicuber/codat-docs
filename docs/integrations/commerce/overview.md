import { IntegrationsList } from "@components/global/Integrations";

Our suite of commerce integrations allow you to retrieve up-to-date ecommerce, payment, and point-of-sale data from your SMB customers' commerce platforms.

## Supported commerce platforms

You can connect to the following commerce platforms using our integrations:

<IntegrationsList sourceType="commerce"/>

`Subscription data` - _Contact your account manager or raise a ticket with our support team through the [support request form](https://codat.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/requests/new) to access these integrations._

To view and compare commerce data coverage by integration, use the <a  class="external" href="https://knowledge.codat.io/supported-features/commerce?view=tab-by-data-type&integrationKey=aiwb&dataType=commerce-companyInfo" target="_blank">Data coverage explorer</a> and select the **Commerce API** product.

## Commerce sandbox

For testing and evaluation, you can use our Commerce Sandbox integration to explore the data you can work with. This doesn't need any setup apart from enabling the integration itself.

## Setting up commerce integrations

Most commerce platforms require you to register with them before you can access data from their platforms through Codat. In most cases, registration is free and only takes a few minutes.

Our documentation details the specific setup steps and requirements for each supported commerce platform.
