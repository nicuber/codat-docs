The **Accounting file upload**, **Banking file upload**, and **Business documents file upload** integrations provide simple file upload functionality.

You can capture your SMB's business documents in addition to contributed data accessed through our main integrations. This may include personal identity documents, pitch decks, contracts, or files with accounting and banking data.

The file upload integrations are available in the Codat Portal in **Settings > Integrations > Other integrations**.

:::caution Scanning for viruses

Although we scan all uploaded files for viruses, we recommend that you do the same for optimum security.

## File upload requirements

Uploaded files must meet the following requirements:

- Up to 20 files can be uploaded at a time.
- PDF, XLS, XLSX, XLSB, CSV, DOC, DOCX, PPT, PPTX, JPEG, JPG, and PNG files can be uploaded.
- Each file can be up to 10MB in size.

## Enable file uploads via Link

To let your SMB customers upload their business documents, you first need to enable the file upload integrations in the Codat Portal at **Settings > Integrations > Other integrations**.

Once enabled, an option to upload files will appear on the relevant platform selection screen. The **Business documents file upload** integration appears as a separate section in your [Link flow](/auth-flow/overview).

Files uploaded by your customers can then be downloaded from within the Codat Portal, or using the **Files** endpoints in the API.
