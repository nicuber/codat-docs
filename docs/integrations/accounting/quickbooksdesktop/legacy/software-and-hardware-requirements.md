## Supported QBD modes

The QBD connector works with QBD running in single-user or multi-user mode. In QBD multi-user mode, users on different machines with different QBD data files can sync data to Codat.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when using the connector with QBD running in either single-user or multi-user mode.

If QuickBooks Desktop is open on the SMB user's machine, the open QuickBooks company file must be the same as the company file that's configured for the connector.

Only one instance of QBD can be open on a user's machine at a time.

If QuickBooks Desktop is closed on the user's machine, syncing will only occur if the relevant option is selected when you [authorize the connector to access QuickBooks](/integrations/accounting/quickbooksdesktop/legacy/installing-the-quickbooks-connector#4-authorize-the-connector-to-access-quickbooks).

## Supported operating systems

The Codat QuickBooks Desktop Connector is supported for QuickBooks running on Windows 10 or Windows 11 with the latest service pack(s) installed.

Users have successfully run the connector on older versions of Windows; however, we do not officially support this due to Microsoft's withdrawal of support for these operating systems.

The connector will not run on Mac OS.

:::note Supported environments

Our QuickBooks Desktop Connector is designed to work in single-tenant environments only, where one Windows user logs on to the same computer they use to access QuickBooks Desktop.

[Installation on Right Networks hosted instances](/integrations/accounting/quickbooksdesktop/legacy/install-qbd-connector-right-networks) is currently in beta.

## Hardware requirements

You will need to ensure that the host machine meets <a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/install-products/system-requirements-quickbooks-desktop-2022/L9664spDA_US_en_US" class="external" target="_blank">Intuit's recommended specification</a> for running QuickBooks Desktop.

If you have a large number of companies, or particularly large company files, you should pay special attention to the consumption of CPU, memory, disk and network resources on the host machine and ensure there is sufficient headroom.

## Firewall rules

The QuickBooks Desktop connector communicates over port 443 to URLs hosted on `https://quickbooksdesktop.codat.io` in production.

If you experience problems with the connector transmitting data, please add the following URLs to your firewall allow list: 

`https://quickbooksdesktop.codat.io/`

`https://connectors.codat.io`
